* Overview
A simple Reticulum packet viewer that works via the [[https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/interfaces.html#pipe-interface][Pipe Interface]]. Build on top
of [[https://crates.io/crates/reticulum-packet-rs][reticulum-packet-rs]]. This is a proof-of-concept.

* Usage
Add a =PipeInterace= in your =rnsd= configuration as such:

#+BEGIN_SRC
[[Pipe Interface]]
    type = PipeInterface
    interface_enabled = True

      # External command to execute
    command = /path/to/reticulum-packet-viewer -v
#+END_SRC

By default this will output in stderr some human readable information about the received
packets. If the =-v/--verbose= flag is passed, the =data= part of the packet
will also be printed as a list of 2 hex characters.
